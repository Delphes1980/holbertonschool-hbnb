The first part of this project is the production of selected UML diagrams and their explanatory notes, the included diagrams are:
- A high-Level package diagram showing a three-layer architecture and the communication between these layers via the facade pattern
- A class diagram showing the different relationships between the classes
- Some sequence diagrams (User Registration, Place Creation, Review Submission, Fetching a list of Places, User Login) for API calls showing the interaction between the layers and the flow of information.
