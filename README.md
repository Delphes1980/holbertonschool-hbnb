# HBnB Evolution
This repository has as objective to recreate ann Airbnb-like application.

It will be composed of four parts:
- Technical documentation (UML)
- Business Logic and API
- [current stage of development] Authentification and Database
- Simple Web Client

## Technical documentation
This documentation will help understand the overall architecture, behavior and responsibilities of the system models, design of the business logic, and the interactions between the different application components.
This documentation will help understand the overall architecture, behavior and responsibilities of the system models, design of the business logic, and the interactions between the different application components.

The first part of this project is the production of selected UML diagrams and their explanatory notes, the included diagrams are:
- A high-Level package diagram showing a three-layer architecture and the communication between these layers via the facade pattern
- A class diagram showing the different relationships between the classes
- Some sequence diagrams (User Registration, Place Creation, Review Submission, Fetching a list of Places, User Login) for API calls showing the interaction between the layers and the flow of information.

## Implementation of Business Logic and API Endpoints
This phase of the HBnB project focuses on building the core functionality of the application using Python and Flask. We'll bring the documented architecture to life by implementing the Presentation and Business Logic layers, defining essential classes, methods, and API endpoints.

The goal is to create a functional and scalable foundation for the application. This involves:

- Business Logic Layer: Developing the core models and logic that drive the application's functionality. This includes defining relationships, handling data validation, and managing interactions between different components.
- Presentation Layer: Defining the services and API endpoints using Flask and Flask-RESTx. We'll structure the endpoints logically, ensuring clear paths and parameters for each operation.
