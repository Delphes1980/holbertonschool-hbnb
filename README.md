# HBnB Evolution
This repository has as objective to recreate a Airbnb-like application.

It will be composed of three parts:
- Technical documentation
- Business Logic and API
- Authentification and Database

## Technical documentation
This documentation will help in understanding the overall architecture, the detailed design of the business logic, and the interactions within the system.

The first part of this project is to do different diagrams:
- A High-Level diagram which shows a three-layers architecture and the communication between these layers via the facade pattern
- A Class diagram which shows the different relationships between the classes
- Several Sequence diagrams (User Registration, Place Creation, Review Submission, Fetching a list of Places, User Loggin) for API calls which shows the interaction between the layers and the flow of information.
